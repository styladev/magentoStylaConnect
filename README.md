# Styla Connect (v 1.0.0.0)
---

Requires:
* PHP >= 5.3. Since Magento 1 itself does not run on PHP7, we haven't tested on this PHP version.
* Magento 1.7 or later, for our Magento 2 plugin check this https://github.com/styladev/magentoStylaConnect2
* Magento REST API activated to share product information http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/m1x/api/rest/introduction.html

Styla Connect is a module to connect your Magento Store with [Styla](http://www.styla.com/) by embedding Styla content on a specific path and providing a source of product data. [This documentation page](https://docs.styla.com/) should provide you an overview of how Styla works in general.

## Setup Process

The process of setting up your Content Hub(s) usually goes as follows:

1. Install and configure the plugin on your stage using Content Hub ID(s) shared by Styla
2. Share the stage URL, credentials with Styla
4. Styla integrates product data from Magento REST API, test your stage Content Hub and asks additional questions, if needed
5. Install and configure the plugin on production, without linking to the Content Hub(s) there and, again, share the URL with Styla
6. Make sure your content is ready to go live
7. Styla conducts final User Acceptance Tests before the go-live
8. Go-live (you link to the Content Hub embedded on your production)

## Important Note for Plugin Updates

If you've used a **pre-0.2.1.0 version** of this this plugin, please let Styla know before updating it. A very quick update on your JS settings will be needed on Styla's end, **otherwise your magazine and landing pages won't work**. 

If you start with installing a **post-0.2.0.2 version**, no changes needed.
